# [TerraFirmaCraft API Documentation](https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/)

This is the host repository for the TerraFirmaCraft API documentation. It is intended for pack makers and addon developers who want to get information on how TFC (official and unofficial) APIs work.

Note: **this is not a wiki!** If you are a player of TFC-TNG, you will not find in-game documentation here. This is for developers of addons and packs using TFC-TNG. For gameplay documentation, consult the [wiki](https://tng.terrafirmacraft.com/Main_Page) instead.
