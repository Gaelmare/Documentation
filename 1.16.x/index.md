# 1.16.x

This is for the **indev** version of TFC v2.x, currently targeting Minecraft 1.16.x. Note, due to this being indev, everything here is subject to change.

### [World Generation](worldgen/)

All of TFC's world generation is available to be customized through vanilla data packs. There are many different pieces, so this will hopefully explain what TFC does, how it does it, and what you can safely modify. (And also, what can be extended with addons or compatibility mods.)

### [Recipes](recipes/)

TFC defines a number of recipe types for everything from Collapsing and Landsliding to... oh wait it's indev that's all we got so far.

### [Data](data/)

In addition to custom recipe types, there are also completely custom data types for stuff such as defining new rocks or metals.
